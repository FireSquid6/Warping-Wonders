## Fork Information
This is a personal fork for my server. We prefer a harder recipe (2 diamond blocks instead of 2 diamonds) for the warp hub and don't want to use all of the other stuff. This removes that. The rest of the readme is left unmodified

## üìñ Description
**Warping Wonders** allows for a more immersive player teleportation utilizing already existing items. Using a **compass** which is linked to a lodestone players can teleport back to the lodestone. A **clock** teleports players back to their spawnpoint (bed, respawn anchor) but the clock has a 50% chance to break when doing so. The **recovery compass** can bring players back to their last death location but always gets destroyed in the process. **Goat Horns** can be used to open a rift to which other players can teleport to by also using a goat horn. All teleports are working where ever a player currently are and across all dimensions and also teleport you alongside leashed entities (including boats). 

## üõ†Ô∏è How to, Instructions & Commands
The datapack usually just needs to be installed. There is nothing else you have to do. It just works out of the box.

Simply equip a compass, clock or recovery compass and right click it in order to teleport to either a linked lodestone, spawnpoint or last death location. Teleports have a cooldown of 15 seconds. <br>
Player rifts can be opened by using a goat horn. the player who opened a rift cannot teleport to it themself. Other players can teleport to the rift by also using a goat horn. Opened rifts are announced via actionbar message and stay open for 30 seconds. Only one rift can be opened at the same time.

Goat horn teleport functionalities can be en-/disabled on a per player base with the **/trigger goat_horn_tpa** command. 

Also adds a new craftable item, the Lodestone Hub. This item can store up to 27 Lodestone Compasses for easy access in its menu. You can even teleport to the locations when the linked lodestone was broken (as long as you do not take out the item from the lodestone hub).

Most features can be en-/disabled completly within the settings menu. **/function wawo:settings**

Other than that the netherite scrap in the lodestone recipe is changed out for raw iron/gold/copper in order to make the lodestone a vailable option for warps.
